Just some art assets I've made, am making, and will continue to make. Likely to be used for my games, though anyone can use them for whatever they want as well. Preferably, they'd give credit to me for this, but I'd not call it necessary by any means, unless you use it for some kind of commercial use, in which case I'd like to be mentioned. I don't much care how you give credit, just mention that I made these, maybe link my Github, or whatever you like. These are mostly for my own personal use, or rather, for my games, but I like to share them in case someone else might benefit from them. Use them how you please, I don't much care how you use 'em, just have fun. :)

Pretty much everything here is pixel art, I try to keep it consistent. It's mostly made using Pixelorama. I'll also put notes up with each upload where I feel they might be relevant, in case they're of use to myself later, or to you.
